## Setup

Clone the repository and open your command line console of choice in the folder. Next, make sure you have node.js and NPM installed (and Yarn, if you wish).

### NPM

Install dependencies: `npm install`

*Either* make a production build: `npm run build`

*Or* run the dev server: `npm run dev`

## Note

You require a premium Crunchyroll account to use Smoothroll.

Smoothroll does not store **any** of your data on its servers. It is simply an interface that sits on top of Crunchyroll.
